# LoL data pipeline and frontend
The "LoL Data Pipeline" Git repository is an evolving project aimed at providing insightful analysis of League of Legends gameplay through a data-driven approach. At its core, the project leverages the game's API to extract match timeline data, which is then normalized and stored in a PostgreSQL database. The project features a user-friendly Streamlit interface, allowing users to input summoner names and interact directly with the data. This interaction encompasses fetching summoner details, retrieving match IDs, and offering a partial visualization of match data.

Future aspirations include enhancing error handling, expanding match visualizations, and implementing time-series data charts. Additionally, improvements in frontend design, comprehensive testing, and preparing for remote hosting are on the horizon. This humble endeavor aims not only to deepen understanding of game dynamics but also to provide an engaging platform for users to explore and analyze League of Legends data.
