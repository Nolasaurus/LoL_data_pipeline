# LoL Data Pipeline

This project strives to implement the following features:

- **Basic API Functionality:** Enables interaction with the LoL API.
- **Match Timeline Data Extraction:** Retrieves detailed timeline data for matches.
- **3NF Data Upload to PostgreSQL:** Structures and uploads data to a PostgreSQL database in third normal form (3NF).
- **Match Data Presentation:** Utilizes Streamlit frontend to present match data.

## Completed Items

- **Streamlit Interface:** Basic user interface for summoner name input.
- **Summoner Data Retrieval:** Fetches summoner details using the input name.
- **Match Data Fetching:** Retrieves match IDs for a given summoner.
- **Match Data Visualization:** Partial implementation (e.g., `plot_gold_by_frame()` method in `MatchOverclass`).
- **Error Handling:** Basic handling for API calls and data processing.
- **SQL Query Execution Interface:** A section in the Streamlit app for executing custom SQL queries against the database.
- **Docker Integration:** Containerization of the Streamlit frontend and PostgreSQL database.

## Yet-to-be-Completed Items

- **Comprehensive Error Handling:** Enhancements for robustness.
- **Full Match Visualization:** Expanding visualization to include KDA, gold, items, level, damage, etc.
- **Time-Series Data Visualization:** Implementing line charts for gold, level, and XP for all match participants.
- **Result Display for SQL Queries:** Handling and displaying results, particularly for SELECT statements.
- **Frontend Aesthetics and Usability:** Improving user interface for better experience and aesthetics.
- **Testing and Debugging:** Comprehensive testing to ensure functionality and reliability.
- **Deployment and Accessibility:** Preparation for remote hosting with server configuration and security considerations (potentially Azure).
